# PLDL

In this question, we will focus on applying unsupervised learning to features (and associating labels). You are provided with a dataset of facebook posts(with the train/dev/test split) and with reactions (in this cases our labels). The following steps will guide you through on how to build your experimental setup for this question. We will be using KL-divergence as the loss function as we are working with probability distributions.
